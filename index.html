    <h3>Hello and Welcome!</h3><br>

    <p>If you are here, chances are you want to know something about me. 
        So here is an abbreviated “byte".
    </p>
<br>
    <p>I am a mother, wife and registered dietitian and live in Hall County Georgia,
        although I have lived in several different states. I have college degrees in
        Dietetics and Commercial Art with a concentration in photography and a minor
        in Spanish.
    </p>
<br>
    <p>I have work experience in large corporations such as USA Today/Gannett, 
        Emory University Hospitals and Northeast Georgia Health System as well as smaller organizations
        like Formula One, ACOM and DRV Technologies. I have an entrepreneurial spirit
        and have been part of 3 new business ventures (Blueprint – a tab-sized newspaper
        for the construction industry, DRV technologies – a forms software development
        company, and Hope Nutrition Counseling, my private nutrition counseling services).
        </p>
<br>   
    <p>On occasion I take photographs for Lakeside News newspaper, have been mentioned in
        Georgia Trend Magazine and built the desktop computer I use at home. All of this is
        to say that I have a wide variety of skills and experiences that provide a solid
        foundation for work as a web developer.</p>
<br>
    <p><i>Now I know what you are thinking –</i></p>
    <p>How does a dietitian find her way to web development
         and what skills could they possibly share?  Here are just a few:</p>
<br>
<div class="indented">
<ul>
    <li><b><p>Accountability</p></b>
         <p>– No matter if I am commenting programming code or signing the electronic medical record, both actions demonstrate accountability for my work. </p>
    </li>
    <li><b><p>Problem-solving</p></b>
        <p>– Both programming and dietetics require problem solving skills and have structured
             methods to aid in the process.  Assess the situation (assessment), determine the
             problem to be addressed (diagnosis), decide a course of action and implement
             (intervention), then follow-up to make sure the problem was resolved to satisfaction
             (monitor and evaluate). </p>
    </li>
    <li><b><p>Continuing Education</p></b>
        <p> – Technology and healthcare are becoming more intertwined and both fields change quickly.
              Keeping up with industry advancements through professional affiliations, journals,
              trade shows, certifications and formal classes are necessary to maintain the level
              of commitment necessary to be successful. </p>
    </li>
    <li><b><p>Communication</p></b>
        <p>– The ability to condense and translate technical knowledge and jargon into something
             comprehensible by the average person is necessary for effective communication.
             Listening to the client to discover their needs, assessing skill level, reading
             visual cues, and translating technical/medical jargon are essential skills in
             both fields. </p>
     </li>
    <li><b><p>Team Work</p></b>
        <p> – Most projects, whether programming or dietetics, involve multiple people and
              departments. The ability to predict how changes might affect others may prevent 
              costly errors or lost opportunities. Engaging co-workers on a project can save
              time, build on unique strengths and verify that everyone has the same
              understanding of the assigned task. Sending a consensus message to the 
              patient or client prevents confusion and builds confidence. </p>
    </li>
    <li><b><p>Graphic Arts and Layout Skills</p></b>
        <p> – Much of dietetics is rooted in education. The ability to create appealing training
              materials, with content tailored to the intended audience enhances the dietitian’s
              ability to communicate with patients and peers. The same is true in web development. </p>
      </li>
</ul>
